This first real programming homework but the implementation will be
relatively easy.  The most important parts of this homework (and
probably the hardest, to be honest) are to understand how I do
homeworks for the course, my coding style, and the level of coding
required for the course.

But we still want to do something relevant to the material of the
course, so we'll be computing [tf-idf
representations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bult.274)
of documents.

Big Picture
=============

The goal here is to create tf-idf representations of documents.  You
won't do it in this homework "for real" (i.e., in a way that can scale
up to thousands of documents), but this allows you to take a query and
find the closest document ... the math and code will be legit, just
not very efficient.

But to define "closest", we need to define a vector space over
documents.  So what are the dimensions of this vector space?  Words!

In other words, we'll be building a matrix `_doc_vectors` in the
code.  It will have rows corresponding to the number of documents and
columns corresponding to the number of words.  But at first we don't
know how many words or documents we have, so we'll do this in three
steps:
 * Find out how many words we have
 * Find out how many documents we have
 * Build the matrix

What's the Vocab
---------------

Now, we could do this more efficiently without three passes, but this
will make debugging simpler.  After the first two steps, to let the
code know that we're done, we'll call the `finalize_vocab` and
`finalize_docs` functions to tell the code to not let that change any
more.  After that point, we won't be able to tell the code that we've
seen new words or new documents.

So the very first step of this process is going to map an individual
word to an integer.  For example, "enterprise" is 1701 and "valjean"
is 24601.  For this homework, we're going to call this process the
"vocabulary lookup": look up the integer that will represent it, and
return that.  That integer will then corespond to the dimension of a
very large vector space.

Take a look at the function ``vocab_lookup`` to see what that looks
like.  You don't need to implement that exact function, but you will
need to figure out what goes into the vocab.  Simple, right?

Now, of course there are some complications.  
  
First complication: what if after we've seen a new word that wasn't in the
vocabulary?  Anything that isn't mapped to the vocabulary will then
become the "unknown token" (`kUNK` in the code).
 
That leads to a second complication: we need to compute statistics for
   how often documents have unknown words.  If we add every single
   word in our training set to the vocabulary, then there won't be any
   unknown words and thus no statistics about unknown words.

So what do unknown words look like?  Think about Zipf's law.  There
are very few frequent words but many infrequent words.  So we're
likely to have most of the frequent words in our vocabulary.  That
means we're missing infrequent words.  

So what words that we have seen
will look most like the unknown words that we'll see in the future?
Our least frequent words!  So we'll use the ``unk_cutoff`` argument to
turn all of the words that we initially saw into the unknown token
``kUNK = "<UNK>"``.

What are the Documents?
---------------------

Okay, so that's our vocabulary.  We also need to compute statistics
for tf-idf.  We can't do everything at once, so we'll need to do two
passes over the data.  The first pass will count how many times we see
each word in the training set (using the function ``train_seen``), and
the second pass will compute term and document frequencies (using the
function ``add_document``).  In between those two passes, we'll
finalize our vocabulary to decide the integer lookup of all of our
words (the ``finalize_vocab`` function).

Then, you should have everything you need to compute---for a new
document or query---the tf-idf representation in the ``doc_tfidf``
function!

What to Do
=============

# Code (20 Points)

You'll need to complete several functions in the ToyTfIdf_Guesser class:
* `constructor`
* `vocab_seen`
* `finalize_vocab`
* `scan_document`
* `global_freq`
* `inv_docfreq`
* `__call__`

I'll talk about each of these and what you have to do for them.  Each
of these should be fairly easy to do.  If you find yourself spending
hours on one of these, you're probably overthinking it or doing
something that Python can do for you.

They're listed roughly in the order that you should complete them, but
you obviously need to think about all of them first before you can
start.

constructor
--------------

You don't need to do too much here except for creating datastructures
that you may need to count things up later.  I'd suggest taking a look
at NLTK's
[FreqDist](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html?highlight=freqdist) and/or
refresh your memory on Python
[collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html).

The only trick here is that for going beyond "good enough", everything
that needs to run the idf calculation needs to get saved in the `save`
function.  So if you add anything beyond `_doc_counts` here, you're
going to neeed to save it in the `save` function.

vocab_seen
----------

Here, you'll need to take the *string* representations that you've
seen and keep track of how often you've seen them.

finalize_vocab
----------

Once we've done a scan over all of the documents, we can create a
vocabulary, taking all of the words that have appeared more than or
equal to unk_cutoff times into the vocabulary.  You make want to free
up the memory you used for train_seen here, but not necessary for
getting a good grade.

The most important thing is that after this function has run, the
vocab data member of TfIdf should map words (in string form) to their
vocabulary id (an integer).

scan_document
---------

Take in a document and keep track of the words that you see in
appropriate datastructures so that the next two functions work.

global_freq
----------

Return the frequency of a word.

inv_docfreq
-------------

Return the inverse document frequency of a word.

`__call__`
-------------

Before you start coding this, remember what this function did in the last
homework: given a query, it needs to find the training item closest to the
query.  To do that, you need to do three things: turn the query into a vector,
compute the similarity of that vector with each row in the matrix, and return
the metadata associated with that row.

We've helped you out by structuring the code so that it should be easy for you
to complete it.  `question_tfidf` is the vector after you embed it.  This code
is already done for you (assuming you've completed `inv_docfreq` already).

Then you'll need to go through the rows in `self._doc_vectors` and find the
closest row.  Call whatever the closest is `best` and return the appropriate
metadata.  This is implemented for you already.

What's "Good Enough"?
==================
If you do all of this, you'll have a fine submission.  To go beyond
that, you'll need to save your code and have it run on the leaderboard
(not just pass the tests).  This means that you'll train a guesser
locally, upload the result, and then that will be scored on the
leaderboard.

The first step is to train your guesser:

This will store a model in the model directory (you might need to
create it if you get an error).  Pay attention to the `limit`
argument, because that's going to save you a lot of time on real data.

Then see how it's doing on an evaluation set:

    jbg@MacBook-Pro-von-Jordan GPT3QA % python3 eval.py --evaluate=guesser --guesser_type='ToyTfidf' --questions=../data/qanta.guessdev.json.gz --limit=100 --load=True --num_guesses=1

Extra Credit (5 Points)
=================

Make your code go faster for both training and testing.  One way to do
this is to override the `batch_guess` function.

You can also get extra credit for submitting new test cases that test
functionality that the supplied tests miss (i.e., if you discover a
bug that isn't covered by our tests, you can get extra credit by
submitting a test that covers it).

# Submission Instructions


1. Submissions will be made on Gradescope.

2. You will submit a zip file containing your code
(toytfidf_guesser.py) and the model files (if you go beyond the "good
enough" standard). If you check your code against your own test cases,
you can add the file (which will be like test.py) containing your own
test cases in the zip too.

The code will run against the public test cases (the ones you can already see
in the given test.py file) on the server and you can see those results. You
should make sure you pass these cases before the submission deadline.

# Hints

1.  Remember to first make sure you pass all of the local unit tests.
2.  NLTK's FreqDist and Python's built in Counter are your friends.
3.  Make sure you use the right base log.
4.  Look at the main function to see how the code will be called and
    then figure out what's missing from the code.

FAQ
============

**Q: Why are we computing `global_freq`, it doesn't seem to be needed
for tf-df.**

**A:** That's right.  But it's easy to write a unit test for, and the
logic for computing it will help you compute the document frequencies.

**Q: In the unit tests, how do we have one token that has frequency
2/3 and two different tokens that have frequency 1/3?**

**A:** They're not really two different tokens, they both got mapped
to the unknown token.
