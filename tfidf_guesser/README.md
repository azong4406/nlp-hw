Nearest Neighbor Question Answering (Guessing)
=

Overview
--------

In this homework you'll implement a nearest neighbor approach to answering
questions.  Given a question you find the most similar question to it, and
answer with the answer to that question.

This first step is meant to be very simple.  If you're spending a
lot of time on this assignment, you are either:

* seriously over-thinking the assignment
* trying to reimplement too much of the assignment

Most of this assignment will be done by calling libraries that have already
been implemented for you.  If you are over-implementing, you are generating
extra work for yourself and making yourself vulnerable to errors.

You'll turn in your code on Gradescope.

What you have to do
----

Coding (15 points in the tfidf_guesser.py):

1.  (Optional) Store necessary data in the constructor so you can do retrieval later.
1.  Modify the _train_ function so that the class stores what it needs to store to guess at what the answer is.
1.  Modify the _call_ function so that it finds the closest indicies (in terms of *cosine* similarity) to the query.

Analysis (5 points):

1.  What answers get confused with each other most easily?  What kinds of
    mistakes does this guesser make?
1.  How does this guesser compare to GPT?  (Remember that the cached guesser from the feature engineering homework came from GPT3.)
1.  Compute recall as you increase the number of guesses.

Accuracy (10 points): How well you do on the recall leaderboard.

What you don't have to do
-------

You don't have to (and shouldn't!) compute tf-idf yourself.  We did that in
a previous homework, so you can leave that to the professionals.  We encourage
you to use the tf-idf vectorizer from sklearn: play around with different settings of the
paramters.  You probably shouldn't modify it, but it's probably useful to
understand it for future homeworks (you'll need to write/call code like it in
the future).

You also don't have to save the vectorizer and tfidf representations, we'll do
that for you.  Take a look at the base guesser class, it needs to track the
questions and answer.  This will also be saved to a pickle.

Unit tests

To test that your basic functionality works, run the provided unit
tests:

Your numeric results might not exactly match the similarities here,
but the ranking should still be consistent.

What to turn in
-

1.  Submit your _tfidf_guesser.py_ file
2.  If you create new features (or reuse features from the feature engineering
homework), also upload your _params.py_ and _features.py_ files.
3. Submit the ``TfidfGuesser.answers.pkl``,
   ``TfidfGuesser.questions.pkl``, ``TfidfGuesser.tfidf.pkl`` and the
   ``TfidfGuesser.vectorizer.pkl`` files that encode your model. 
4.  Submit your _analysis.pdf_ file (no more than one page; pictures
    are better than text)

Extra Credit
=

There will be two different places to submit your code on Gradescope:
one that only tests the guesser, one that specifically tests the
buzzer.  The guesser evaluation will retrain your model, the buzzer
evaluation will use the the model directly.  
1. Optimize the retrieval mechanism by tuning parameters, weighting, and/or using
   bigrams.
2. Do well in the overall leaderboard (while overall buzz ratio and accuracy is important, more
   important is using features that take advantage of tfidf guesser features or
   multiple guessers.
3. Add additional tf-idf guessers (e.g., from the provided Wikipedia pages).  You can create an additional
    guesser if you want to keep it separate from the tfidf_guesser.  If you do
    that, make sure to upload that file too.
4. Finally, you can get extra credit for by submitting your system on Dynabench (assuming
   we can get it up in time ... watch Piazza for announcements).


Example
-

Let's first test out the train function; you must run this before the eval
function, because this establishes your tf-idf index.

    python3 guesser.py --guesser_type=TfidfGuesser --question_source=gzjson
    --questions=../data/qanta.guesstrain.json.gz --logging_file=guesser.log
    --limit=10
    100%|█████████████████████████████████████████| 10/10 [00:00<00:00, 2743.89it/s]
    100%|███████████████████████████████████████| 10/10 [00:00<00:00, 441505.68it/s]


This outputs the vectorizer (which turns text into a matrix) into the models
directory (you might need to create the directory called ``models``).  After
you've done that, you can now run the guesser.

*BEWARE*: The code I've given you runs end to end, but it's not correct.  It
 creates random representations of all of the documents and the retrieval
 component always returns the zeroth document.  This is why eval will always
 answer the same darn answer to all of the questions.  You'll obviously need
 to fix this.

This is an example of how you can run the ```buzzer.py``` file on the ```qanta.guesstrain.json.gz``` file to generate the buzzer pickle files:
```
python3 buzzer.py --guesser_type=TfidfGuesser --limit=50  --question_source=gzjson --TfidfGuesser_filename=models/TfidfGuesser  --questions=../data/qanta.guesstrain.json.gz --buzzer_guessers=TfidfGuesser
```

This is an example of what your code (tfidf_guesser.py) output should look like:
```
> python3 eval.py --evaluate=guesser --question_source=gzjson \
--questions=../data/qanta.guessdev.json.gz --limit=500

                      "psychological critique" defends this act by citing how art nourishes
                      the irrational part of the soul. The "metaphysical critique" which

Hints
-

1.  Don't use all of the data, especially at first.  Use the _limit_
    command line argument (as in the above example).
2.  In case you see an error that your submission timed out on Gradescope, that means that your code needs to be simplified. 
    This is essential for your  code to work on Gradescope, so think of ways
    you can optimize your code.  Another issue if
    if you're trying to create the matrix one row at a time; it's possible to
    do it in batch.
2.  Another problem with the submission might be that your pickle file (how your vectorizer / matrix is saved) is too large (Gradescope has a 100MB limit).  Remember that your tf-idf representation is a matrix.  It could be that your tf-idf representation
    is too wide (too many terms) or too tall (too many documents).  You had to
    deal with this before in your previous tf-idf homework.  
5.  The leaderboard will report both retrieval accuracy and final buzz
    accuracy.  Both are important, as you can only decide if a guess is
    correct if the correct guess is an option.
2.  tf-idf representations do not know anything about syntax or part of
    speech.  You could add features to correct some of these problems.  (This
    is just for the extra credit!)    
6.  Don't forget about the definition of what a token is and how it's flexible.  The sklearn
    tokenizer does support n-grams, which may help you in the extra credit (but consume more
    memory):
    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html 
7.  *Do not focus on buzzer accuracy*!  When your guesser is broken, all of
    the guesses will be wrong and you'll trivially get perfect buzz accuracy
    (always wait).  Unless you're going for going after extra credit, you should pay attention to precision and recall (which are specific to the guesser).
8.  That said, accuracy comes from the buzzer; if you have a bad
    accuracy score despite updating the guesser, it's possible that
    the pickle for your buzzer has not been updated and is looking for
    the wrong features (or is miscalibrated). 
9.  Once you've completed the required part of the homework and you're
    trying to increase the recall further, you can investigate
    changing the dimensions of the vectorization: what normalization
    is applied to the words, what data are included, or looking at
    n-grams.  Also don't forget
